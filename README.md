Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic revolutionized digital healthcare delivery, propelling tele-rehabilitation into mainstream practice. This paper explores how digital physiotherapy enhances accessibility, affordability, and equity in healthcare. Drawing on global studies (2018–2024) within the frameworks of WHO’s Rehabilitation 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, it demonstrates that tele-rehabilitation yields outcomes comparable to conventional therapy while vastly extending reach. Yet, challenges persist—limited internet coverage, inadequate digital literacy, and policy gaps hinder widespread adoption. To transform tele-rehabilitation into a sustainable pillar of public health, nations must invest in digital infrastructure, clinician training, and robust data-protection mechanisms.

Introduction

Rehabilitation is an essential component of universal health coverage but often receives insufficient attention. Tele-rehabilitation, encompassing video consultations, mobile-health applications, and remote monitoring, provides a flexible means to continue physiotherapy beyond clinical walls. Evidence increasingly affirms that online physiotherapy is equally effective as in-person care for musculoskeletal pain, neurological rehabilitation, and post-operative recovery. Endorsed by WHO’s Rehabilitation 2030 initiative, this digital shift strengthens accessibility, minimizes inequalities, and integrates rehabilitation into global health agendas.

Objectives

Examine tele-rehabilitation’s contribution to equitable physiotherapy access.
Evaluate its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
Identify systemic and technological barriers to large-scale implementation.

Results and Discussion

Tele-rehabilitation bridges the care divide for individuals in rural, remote, or underserved regions, eliminating the need for travel while maintaining therapeutic quality. Research consistently shows heightened patient engagement, improved adherence, and satisfaction rates. Clinical outcomes parallel traditional rehabilitation, with cost savings averaging 25–35%.
However, digital disparities, fragmented policies, and data-security vulnerabilities remain pressing concerns. Effective integration demands strategic governmental action: expanding broadband access, enhancing digital competency among health professionals, and enforcing rigorous data-privacy standards.

Public Health Impact

Tele-rehabilitation strengthens preventive health, functional independence, and chronic disease management. By embedding digital rehabilitation into primary health systems, countries can curb long-term healthcare expenditure, improve service continuity, and uplift the quality of life for populations with disabilities or chronic conditions. Its community-based approach aligns with the core values of equity, inclusion, and sustainability central to public health.

Conclusion

Tele-rehabilitation has evolved beyond an emergency-era remedy into a transformative, enduring strategy for public-health advancement. With coordinated investments in training, technology, and regulation, digital physiotherapy can democratize access to rehabilitation services, ensuring that no individual is excluded from essential care in the digital age
