Overview

This study investigates how digital physiotherapy and tele-rehabilitation can enhance accessibility and equity in healthcare delivery, especially within public health frameworks. It aligns with the World Health Organization‚Äôs ‚ÄúRehabilitation 2030‚Äù initiative and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on digital transformation and inclusion in rehabilitation systems.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of tele-rehabilitation compared with conventional in-person physiotherapy.
To assess its influence on accessibility, cost-efficiency, and patient engagement.
To identify barriers and policy gaps affecting large-scale adoption of digital rehabilitation in public health.

Key Findings

Comparable Clinical Outcomes: Tele-rehabilitation yields similar therapeutic outcomes to traditional physiotherapy for musculoskeletal, neurological, and post-operative conditions.
Improved Accessibility: Extends rehabilitation services to rural and remote populations, minimizing travel and enhancing continuity of care.
Economic Benefits: Demonstrates cost savings averaging 25‚Äì35%, making rehabilitation more affordable.
Patient Engagement: Higher adherence and satisfaction observed in digitally guided home-based sessions.

Challenges Identified

Inadequate internet and digital infrastructure in low-resource areas.
Limited digital literacy among patients and healthcare providers.
Weak legal and ethical frameworks for data privacy and tele-health regulation.
Poor integration of digital systems into existing healthcare networks.

Recommendations

Expand broadband coverage and tele-health infrastructure to support nationwide implementation.
Include digital rehabilitation training within physiotherapy and occupational therapy education.
Establish national policy frameworks ensuring privacy, equity, and ethical practice in tele-health.
Integrate tele-rehabilitation into primary and community healthcare systems for sustainable service delivery.

Relevance

This research contributes to the evolving field of digital rehabilitation and public health, providing a foundation for future policy, education, and clinical research. It emphasizes how technology can advance universal health coverage, especially in regions with limited access to traditional rehabilitation services.
